CheapBotsDoneQuick-like python bot for Twitter

Why? Because of the recent suspension of CBDQ API Access, I am making a script that can 
simulate the same behavior as the CBDQ bots. This script is obviously a very wip.
JSON schemas are exactly the same as the CBDQ bots, so you can just copy and paste the
JSON files from the CBDQ bots into the same directory as this script and a few script
changes and you're good to go.
